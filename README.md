I am a programmer and creator of some applications that are used nowadays! such as: DarkHorse, Synapse and Pluck. <br></br>
on my profile, I will make the code of these apps available for free, but if you use any of them, please credit my work! this helps me a lot and motivates me to keep doing it! I am currently extremely focused on learning the rust language because it has an emphasis on performance and security. besides I really like open source projects and messing with Node.JS and Webkit, Python and Electron! I'm in love with C-Sharp <3 <br></br>
i'm mainly interested in games, i love spending all my time playing, when i'm bored i decide to go crazy and make programs, websites or even develop games, but most of these projects end up not going very far sooo that's it !
